# Primel-Helper
A program that helps you solve Primel - game based on Wordle - where you have to guess a 5 digit prime number

For a few weeks now I have been playing a game called Primel and because I don't know prime numbers I found a page that has a list of all 5 digit prime numbers. That's where I have been searching for the answers for it. And thet I rememberd I could write myself a code that will help me. 

Currently the code is probably not really readable and as I learn to code I'll try to fix it. But it works.
You can run it in your command prompt.

Then you'll be greeted like this!

You then input a number 1-4 or q if you wanna quit, depending on your number you will be given next prompt. After each you'll be taken to the MENU where you can choose again. 

I have decided to include printing of the list or a lenght of the list cause maybe it will interest someone.
